== Unobtrusive Forinsecal Organizer

The abduction story is typical, and doesn't hold any elements of surprise
for people well-versed in encounters with our gray-skinned "friends". Perhaps
the only odd detail is that in my case, they weren't after my livestock or my
bodily fluids, but they really wanted to collect all the old ways of
configuring Perl 6 projects. Collect them and *destroy* them. Blast them out
of existence.

In return, they handed me a small hand-held device with the letters "ufo" on
the side.  From now on -- they told me -- whenever I would fall back to my
primitively human urge to create a Makefile, I would just activate the
device...

$ ufo

...and it would create the Makefile for me, using 'ambient information'.

When they told me this, they had already beamed me up to their vessel and
treated me to the best sirloin steak I've *ever* tasted, period. I was a little
tipsy from the excellent wine, too, but not to the point of being drunk. Entire
galaxies swooped past outside the ship's windows like they do in exceedingly
bad movies. I peered at the device.

"Ok, um," I began. "It's important that the modules be built in a certain
order, sort of like a dependency order, you know. Otherwise the build process
will be unnecessarily slow because of re-parses. See what I mean?"

They looked at me pityingly, like you'd look at a pre-schooler who wants to
know all about quantum computing.

"Yes. The build order will be optimized. Try not to think too much, you've
had a busy day."

Having no other question, I was beamed back to an isolated cow pasture not
far from where I live. Somehow I knew that my task was now to locate the
remaining 'Makefile.PL' and 'Configure' files and their brethren, and convince
others to remove them so that humanity could finally unshackle itself from its
archaic technology.

And no-one would believe that my story wasn't anything other than a dream.
Except that I still carry this small device they gave me...
